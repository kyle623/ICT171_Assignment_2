            The Diablo 4 World Boss Trackeris a lightweight cloud-based web app designed to 
            help keep players keep track of upcoming world boss spawns in Diablo 4. Built by using
            Amazon EC2, under an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) model, the tracker displays 
            estimated spawn times for the world bosses without requireing users to log into 
            the game or manually monitor in-game timers.
        </p>
        <p>
            The purpose of the project is to create a simple, easy tool that players can open on any 
            device (PC, tablet or phone) to see when the next world boss is expected to spawn. Instead 
            of having to be in the game and checking for bosses to spawn, players can plan their time 
            better and jump into Diablo 4 when the boss event is close.
        </p>
        <p>
            The spawn times are displayed based on typical spawn patterns and estimation. Because world bosses 
            do not always appear at fixed times, the tracker gives players the best available guess, updated 
            automaticallyover time. It is intended to serve as a reference rather than a notification system. 
            The applicaiton does not send active notifications or alerts. It is a simple web page that refreshes 
            its information periodically, making it easy for users to check on demand without signing up 
            or downloading anything.
        </p>

            This project uses Amazon EC2 to ensure that it is always available online without needing personal 
            server hardware. Hosting it in clouud also means that players in different locations, including 
            Oceania region, can access it with minimal loading times as it is hosted on Singapore. The tracker 
            was specifically build for convenience, allowing players to enjoy the rest of the day without 
            constantly logging into Diablo 4 just to check the boss schedules.

            I have chosen the MIT Licence for this project because it is simple, permissive and encourages 
            use. It allows anyone to freely use, modify and distribute the code, which supports the open-source 
            development and collab. The MIT Licence is also GPL-compatible, meaning that if I wish to switch 
            to a more restrictive licence like GPL in the future, I retain that flexibility. The MIT Licence 
            includes a clear liability disclaimer. As I am still gaining experience, I want to ensure that 
            I am not legally held for any issues caused by the use of my software.
